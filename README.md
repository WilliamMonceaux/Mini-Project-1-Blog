My project is a chess blog website. The idea is basically my social media draft from Module 4 Lab 1. I decided to go about making this project since I am interested in chess
and thought it would be a cool idea to make a blog website dedicated to people who are also interested in chess. I used an assortment of concepts that I have learned up to this point
In this course, I hope it comes to y'all satisfaction.
