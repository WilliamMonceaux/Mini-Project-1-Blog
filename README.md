My project is a chess blog website. The idea is basically my social media draft from Module 4 Lab 1. I decided to go about making this project since I am interested in chess
and thought it would be a cool idea to make a blog website dedicated to people who are also interested in chess and wanted to keep up with the latest professional chess news. I used an assortment of concepts that I have learned up to this point In this course. I hope it comes to y'all satisfaction.

Requirements gathered:
- Requiring a landing page for the user to see the main content of the website
- an account creation form for the user to create an account and make post on the homepage timeline and create threads
- Developing a logout button for the user to logout when signed in
- A submit form to make a post to timeline and for creating an account
- A Navigation bar for users to navigate to signup page, creating threads page, and to the about the developer page

External resources used:
Bootstrap (layouts, cards, forms, etc.)
