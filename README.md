# Mini-Project-1

This is the first major coding project designed to consolidate everything learned in Modules 1 - 4: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Fetch, Axios, Bootstrap

## Overview

This is the first of three Mini Projects that will be conducted over the course. This first one is designed to consolidate everything learned in **Modules 1 - 4**. You'll build a small web application that demonstrates your ability to combine **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to create a functional, interactive, and visually appealing website.

A good reference to the scope and structure of this project can be found in **Module 4: Lab 10: Web-E-Commerce** _Module 4 slide 91_.

Your project should demonstrate creativity, solid front-ed development practices, and the ability to connect and present data from an external or internal source.

## Project Goals

Your web app should:

- Include **multiple pages** with consistent navigation
- Demonstrate **semantic HTML structure**
- Apply **CSS styling** using classes, IDs, and layout tools
- Fetch and display **relevant data** from an external or local JSON file
- Incorporate **JavaScript interactivity** and DOM manipulation
- Use at least one **external tool or library** (e.g. Bootstrap, Axios, Chart.js)
- Be version-controlled using **Git** with meaningful commits and branches
- Be clearly explained during a **5 - 10 minute presentation**

## Presentation Goals

During your presentation, address the following:

1. What was your **requirements gathering and design process**? Was it useful or successful?
2. Provide a **high-level overview** of your application and its features.
3. Describe your **data flow**:
   - Where does your data come from (external/internal APIs or local JSON)?
   - How is it processed and displayed?
   - How does the user interact with it?
4. What **JavaScript techniques** have you used?  
   (e.g., objects, arrays, DOM functions, loops, functions)
5. What **external tools or libraries** have you used?  
   (e.g., Bootstrap, Axios, Chart.js) — How and why did you choose them?
6. What **HTML elements** did you include?  
   (e.g., tables, forms, lists, videos, images, navigation menus)
7. What **CSS features** have you applied?  
   (e.g., animations, colors, backgrounds, fonts, Flexbox, Grid)
8. What challenges did you face, and how did you solve them?
9. How might you **extend or improve** your application in the future?

## Minimum Viable Project (MVP)

Your project must include:

- [ ] A **design plan** (wireframe, sketch, or brief description of layout and navigation)
- [ ] At least **three distinct pages** connected by clear navigation
- [ ] Use of **semantic HTML tags** (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, etc.)
- [ ] Use of **classes and IDs** for styling and structure
- [ ] **Fetched data** displayed on the page using `fetch()` or `Axios`
- [ ] Integration of at least one **Bootstrap element or class**
- [ ] Proper **Git version control** (meaningful commits, repository hosted on GitHub, distinct branches)
- [ ] Minimum 2 Branches, merged into **main** via **Pull Requests**
- [ ] A **5–10 minute presentation** explaining your app, process, and code

## Optional Enhancements (Stretch Goals)

Not required, but these can elevate your project:

- Responsive design using media queries
- More advanced interactivity (search, sort, or filters)
- Custom CSS animations or transitions
- Additional data visualizations (charts, graphs, etc.)
- Deployment to GitHub Pages or Netlify
- Use of icons, fonts, or external APIs for improved presentation

## Rubric

| Category                 | Description                                                                    |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Business Context**     | Clear explanation of the app’s purpose, target audience, and problem it solves |
| **Presentation Quality** | Engaging, well-structured, 5–10 minutes, effectively demonstrates project      |
| **Code Quality**         | Clean, well-commented, semantic HTML, organized CSS, functional JavaScript     |
| **Functionality**        | App runs without errors, features work as intended, data displays correctly    |
| **Use of Tools**         | Effective use of Git, external libraries, and Bootstrap integration            |
| **Documentation**        | README includes setup instructions, description, and contributor info          |

## Tips for Success

- Commit **early and often** to Git with meaningful messages
- Keep your **scope realistic** — focus on quality and polish over quantity
- Check your code for **accessibility and semantics**
- Practice your **presentation** to stay within the time limit
- Have fun — creativity counts
